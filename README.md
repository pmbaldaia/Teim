> The TEIM platform emerged as part of an interdisciplinary project of the School of Media Arts and Design, also known as ESMAPP. Each group was assigned a customer at the beginning of the school year, and from then on, the goal was to develop the product that the customer had in mind. The client was looking for a mobile platform that would help improve time organization within his company, by allowing his employees to record their daily tasks, as well as their duration.
